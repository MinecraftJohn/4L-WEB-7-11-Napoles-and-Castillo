### What is this?

This project is a school performance project for subject Software Development 244 and WEB 241. Its core purpose is to discover something new and improve my web development skill.

This was my first web development for a school web project task. The [page output](https://github.com/MinecraftJohn/7-eleven/tree/main/assets) and its [assets](https://github.com/MinecraftJohn/7-eleven/tree/main/assets/images) are given to us, so it's up to me how to imitate the expected output using CSS. The UX was based on my imagination including the form validation message. As time goes by we have made it to dive into back-end. Using XAMPP I was able to run a local server and database.

It was a greate experience, challenging and fun web development exercise. Making a project indeed needs a team colaboration, especially a project like this.
