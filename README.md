This was my first web development for a school performance task. The page output and its assets are given to us, so it's up to me how to imitate the expected output using CSS. The UX was based on my imagination including the form validation message. As time goes by we have made it to dive into back-end. Using XAMPP I was able to run a local server and database.

It was a greate experience, challenging and fun web development exercise. Making a project indeed needs a team colaboration, especially a project like this.
